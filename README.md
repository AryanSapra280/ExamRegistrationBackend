# **EXAM Registration Backend**

This is a robust, scalable solution written in Java using Spring Boot. We have followed the Spring MVC architecture and implemented GlobalException. The database used is MySQL, and we have used Hibernate to communicate with the database.

We have implemented CRUD APIs and have attached a Postman collection. You can clone and quickly run it by setting the DB connection at port 3306.
